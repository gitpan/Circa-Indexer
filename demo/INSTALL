Update this script:

admin.pl : Command line interface
admin_compte.cgi : CGI Interface for administrate one account
admin.cgi : General CGI Interface

And set this:

my $user = "alian";  # set your database User
my $pass = "";   # set your database password
my $db    = "circa";  # set your database name

For the two CGI file, set too this:

my $rep = "/home/alian/project/Circa/Indexer/demo/ecrans/";
where your html admin files are

Then, you can do:

In command line:
admin.pl +create +add=http://www.monsite.com +update=1
for index your first url.

With CGI: 
Just run admin.cgi
